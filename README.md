# Spore Recognition for Plant Disease Detection

This project presents a machine learning model designed to detect plant diseases through spore recognition, leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for multiclass classification of spore images. The primary goal is to identify plant diseases by categorizing spores, enabling timely diagnosis and intervention.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Develop a reliable CNN-based model to detect plant diseases via spore image recognition.
- **Method**: Use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for multiclass classification of spore images.
- **Applications**: Early plant disease detection, improved crop health monitoring, and optimized agricultural practices.

## Features

- Multiclass classification of spore images for accurate disease identification
- High-performance model with reliable accuracy and precision
- Scalable architecture for further extension to include additional spore classes or diseases
