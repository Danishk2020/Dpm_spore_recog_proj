# Spore Recognition for Plant Disease Detection

This project is a deep learning model that classifies spore images to detect plant diseases. By recognizing the presence and type of spores, this model can help identify specific plant diseases early and assist in agricultural disease management.

## Project Overview

The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of spores into multiple categories, each corresponding to a specific plant disease. The spore images are preprocessed and fed into the CNN, which outputs the disease class based on the spore type.

## Features

- **Multiclass Classification**: Classifies spore images into multiple plant disease categories.
- **Deep Learning Architecture**: Built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image recognition tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Danishk2020/DPM_spore_recogn_proj.git
   cd spore-recognition
